# Employee-Performance-Analysis

## Objective: 
The performance of various employees in an organisation varies and so is the probability of
each employee getting promoted. Not getting promoted could have a direct bearing against employee
attrition and hence the HR department would like to know the probablity that an employee will get
promoted.
The objective of this project is to predict whether an employee will get promoted or not and also
understand the factors which impact the promotion.


## About The Dataset
The dataset consists of the following information of 54808 employees:
employee_id: Unique employee ID
department: Department in which the employee works
region: Employee region
education: Education level of the employee
gender: Gender of the employee
recruitment_channel: Channel through which employee was recruited
no_of_trainings: # of training programs the employee has undergone
age: Age of the employee
previous_year_rating: Performance rating of the employee in the previous year

KPIs_met >80%: Has the employee met more than 80% of the KPIs. 0-No;1-Yes
awards_won: Has the employee won any awards? 0-No;1-Yes
avg_training_score: Average training score of the employee

## Project Instructions
Perform the required data pre-processing to treat for missing values and outliers
Perform exploratory data analysis to visualise the spread of each of the X variables and the relationship
between the various X variables and the Y variable
Use the data provided to create employee segments using clustering and visually explore the % of
employees promoted in each segment.
Divide the given data into train and test sets
Build a model to predict whether an employee will get promoted or not
Evaluate the model based on model performance measures for classification and recommend the most
suitable model.
Come up with recommendations / actionable insights based on feature importance scores derived from
the model.
